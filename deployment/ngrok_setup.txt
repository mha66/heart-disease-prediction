Ngrok Setup Guide

This document explains how to set up and use Ngrok to expose your local Streamlit app (or any local server) to the internet.

1. Download and Install Ngrok
- Visit: https://ngrok.com/download
- Download the version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
- Extract the downloaded file.
- (Windows) Move ngrok.exe to a folder like C:\ngrok and add it to your system PATH.

Alternatively, install via pip (Python users):
pip install pyngrok

---

2. Sign Up for a Free Account
- Go to https://ngrok.com
- Sign up for a free account.
- After signing up, copy your Authtoken from the Ngrok dashboard.

---

3. Configure Ngrok with Your Authtoken
Run the following command in your terminal (replace with your actual token):
ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_AUTHTOKEN


This will create a configuration file in your user directory so you don’t have to re-enter the token every time.

---

4. Run Your Streamlit App
Navigate to your project folder and start Streamlit:
streamlit run app.py


By default, Streamlit runs at: http://localhost:8501

---

5. Start Ngrok Tunnel
In a new terminal, run:
ngrok http 8501


You will see output similar to:
Forwarding    https://1234-56-78-910-11.ngrok-free.app -> http://localhost:8501


Copy the HTTPS link and share it — this is your public app URL.

---

6. Keep Processes Running
Remember: Both Streamlit and Ngrok must stay running for the app to remain accessible.


- If Streamlit stops → the app goes down.  
- If Ngrok stops → the public link stops working.


---

7. Optional: Run The Included batch file
To quickly run both Streamlit and Ngrok, run the "run_app.bat" batch file found in "deployment" subdirectory


The batch script will automatically open two new terminal windows and run Streamlit and Ngrok


(Note: Do not move the "run_app.bat" batch file, "app.py" file, or "final_model.pkl" or else the script won't work properly)

---

8. Optional: Use a Custom Subdomain
To get a permanent subdomain (instead of a random URL), run:
ngrok http -subdomain=my-heart-app 8501


Your app will be available at:
https://my-heart-app.ngrok-free.app


(Note: This requires an Ngrok account and may depend on your plan.)

---


Done! You now have Ngrok set up and can share your local Streamlit app publicly.
